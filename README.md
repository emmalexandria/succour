`succour` is a help printer for Rust which provides beautiful, compact, width aware output. It primarily aims to be compatible with clap, but support for other argument parsers is provided through feature flags.

**Simple yet clear**

By default `succour` prints a slightly nicer version of the default clap help output. This ensures an 
easy transition. Most features and enhancements are opt-in, not opt-out.

All output aims for a high level of clarity, with modern terminal features being liberally used to 
improve readability. However, compatibility modes are also offerred.
